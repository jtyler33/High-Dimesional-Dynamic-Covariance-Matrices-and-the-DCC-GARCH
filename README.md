# High-Dimesional-Dynamic-Covariance-Matrices-and-the-DCC-GARCH
Multivariate GARCH models are popular within the risk management and investment
allocation problems. Since the number of assets involved in the portfolio
optimization is substantially large; accordingly, these models suffer from
the curse of dimensionality. The main purpose of the assigned study is to render
the previous DCC framework proposed in the Engle (2002, JBES) robust to
large dimensions.
